# Breast-Cancer-Detection-PRMIM-Project
Breast Cancer Detection and classification from Mammogram images based on GMM Segmentation and GLCM-DWT feature extraction and 
PNN Classification

# Objective
Our objectives in this project are to â€“ pre-processing and noise removal of breast mammogram
images, segment the images to identify Region of Interests (ROI) using Machine Learning
techniques, extract useful feature information using GLCM, DWT and finally classify the
images into three categories after its detection - Normal, Malignant, Benign.
